A stack is a data structure which contains an ordered set of data.

Stacks provide three methods for interaction:

Push - adds data to the “top” of the stack
Pop - returns and removes data from the “top” of the stack
Peek - returns data from the “top” of the stack without removing it

This is a Last In, First Out or LIFO structure. A less frequently used term is First In, Last Out, or FILO.

Stacks can be implemented using a linked list as the underlying data structure because it’s more efficient than a list or array.

Depending on the implementation, the top of the stack is equivalent to the head node of a linked list and the bottom of the stack is equivalent to the tail node.

A constraint that may be placed on a stack is its size. This is done to limit and quantify the resources the data structure will take up when it is “full.”

Attempting to push data onto an already full stack will result in a stack overflow. Similarly, if you attempt to pop data from an empty stack, it will result in a stack underflow.
